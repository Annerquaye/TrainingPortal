##Chronicles

I have always had a knack for trying to game the system since I was little. I am not sure that makes me smart. Perhaps, I should say lazy. I usually gravitate towards the path of least resistance. I hate to be stopped or told what not to do. I would rather have my way and damn the consequences later. As they say, there is always that single incident that changes the course of one's destiny, either for good or bad, depending on how one reacts to it. As it were in most public schools in the 1990s, it was a common place for teachers to take leave of their class either attending to a personal errand or caught up in a meeting with their colleagues. Ms Anim, as we call our basic 5 teacher, was not quite the disciplinarian that most of were accustomed to from our classes. She had resumed teaching at Laterbiokorshie Presby Primary School not long after we moved to her class. The local Presbyterian Church established the school. The church itself traces its foundation from the early days of missionaries from Basel, Switzerland. In pre-independent Ghana, there were a lot of missionaries that arrived on Ghana's shores in search of so-called lost souls to minister to. Never mind that they found indigenes already occupied with their respective deities when they arrived. Through the Bible, they set out to propagate their gospel, which essentially condemned the deities that the indigenes worshipped, describing them either as idols or lesser gods. This was far from a seamless process. One of the means these missionaries, some who came as traders, used to sell their gospel was providing social amenities in places where government's help was lacking. Thus, it was common for many of the initial places of worship built to serve dual purposes for schools as well.
